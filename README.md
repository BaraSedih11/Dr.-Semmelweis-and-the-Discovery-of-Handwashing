This repository contains an implementation of Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing applying data manipulation with pandas in python.

## Overview

In this repository, we demonstrate how to perform data manipulation with pandas. We utilize the pandas library. Additionally, we provide a simple example along with explanations to help you understand how to apply data manipulation to your own datasets.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas 

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `notebook.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code and comments in the notebook to understand how data manipulation in pandas is implemented using Python.
